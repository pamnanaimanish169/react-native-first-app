      'The book is set in 1984 in Oceania, one of three perpetually warring totalitarian states (the other two are Eurasia and Eastasia). Oceania is governed by the all-controlling Party, which has brainwashed the population into unthinking obedience to its leader, Big Brother. The Party has created a propagandistic language known as Newspeak, which is designed to limit free thought and promote the Party’s doctrines. Its words include doublethink (belief in contradictory ideas simultaneously), which is reflected in the Party’s slogans: “War is peace,” “Freedom is slavery,” and “Ignorance is strength.” The Party maintains control through the Thought Police and continual surveillance.The book’s hero, Winston Smith, is a minor party functionary living in a London that is still shattered by a nuclear war that took place not long after World War II. He belongs to the Outer Party, and his job is to rewrite history in the Ministry of Truth, bringing it in line with current political thinking. However, Winston’s longing for truth and decency leads him to secretly rebel against the government. He embarks on a forbidden affair with Julia, a like-minded woman, and they rent a room in a neighbourhood populated by Proles (short for proletariats). Winston also becomes increasingly interested in the Brotherhood, a group of dissenters. Unbeknownst to Winston and Julia, however, they are being watched closely (ubiquitous posters throughout the city warn residents that “Big Brother is watching you.”).When Winston is approached by O’Brien—an official of the Inner Party who appears to be a secret member of the Brotherhood—the trap is set. O’Brien is actually a spy for the Party, on the lookout for “thought-criminals,” and Winston and Julia are eventually caught and sent to the Ministry of Love for a violent reeducation. The ensuing imprisonment, torture, and reeducation of Winston are intended not merely to break him physically or make him submit but to root out his independence and destroy his dignity and humanity. In Room 101, where prisoners are forced into submission by exposure to their worst nightmares, Winston panics as a cage of rats is attached to his head. He yells out for his tormentors to “Do it to Julia!” and states that he does not care what happens to her. With this betrayal, Winston is released. He later encounters Julia, and neither is interested in the other. Instead Winston loves Big Brother.',

      'The Great Gatsby is a novel that needs no introduction for a certain generation of American readers. Long taught as required reading in American schools, critics have consistently held it up alongside Moby Dick, Huck Finn, and To Kill a Mockingbird as perhaps the quintessential Great American Novel. Nick Carraway is a young Midwestern man freshly arrived in New York to make his fortune. He rents a shabby apartment in Long Island next door to a sumptuous mansion: the home of the mysterious and wealthy Jay Gatsby. Carraway spends time catching up with his distant cousin Daisy and her industry-baron husband Tom before being invited to one of Gatsby’s wildly lavish weekend parties. There he meets Jordan, a flapper and a golf star, and an intricate web of romances and betrayals begins to unfold. The novel is a colorful study of America’s Jazz Age—a term said to be coined by Fitzgerald himself—complete with wealthy socialites living in hedonistic abandon, libertine flappers, jazz bands, roaring roadsters, and greasy speakeasies populated with shady grifters. Contrasted against the glamorous lives of wealthy socialites is the entrenched lower class, who live in gray, dingy squalor among smoldering ash-heaps. Fitzgerald uses the setting to examine the American Dream: the idea that anyone in America can achieve success through hard work and dedication. Gatsby has spent his life reaching for his dream. Some say he’s already achieved it. But has he? Is the dream even real for the hard-working poor that Gatsby and Tom race past in their glittering cars on the way to the decadent city? Fitzgerald wrote much of his real life into the novel. Like Carraway, he was a Midwesterner educated at an Ivy-league school who went to live on Long Island. Despite his meager finances he hobnobbed with socialites, and spent his career struggling for money to maintain the grand style his romantic interests were accustomed to.The cover art, titled Celestial Eyes, was commissioned from Francis Cugat, who completed it before the novel was finished. The huge eyes gazing down on the blazing city so moved Fitzgerald that he wrote them into the story.',

      'One Hundred Years of Solitude is the history of the isolated town of Macondo and of the family who founds it, the Buendías. For years, the town has no contact with the outside world, except for gypsies who occasionally visit, peddling technologies like ice and telescopes. The patriarch of the family, José Arcadio Buendía, is impulsive and inquisitive. He remains a leader who is also deeply solitary, alienating himself from other men in his obsessive investigations into mysterious matters. These character traits are inherited by his descendents throughout the novel. His older child, José Arcadio, inherits his vast physical strength and his impetuousness. His younger child, Aureliano, inherits his intense, enigmatic focus. Gradually, the village loses its innocent, solitary state when it establishes contact with other towns in the region. Civil wars begin, bringing violence and death to peaceful Macondo, which, previously, had experienced neither, and Aureliano becomes the leader of the Liberal rebels, achieving fame as Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Macondo changes from an idyllic, magical, and sheltered place to a town irrevocably connected to the outside world through the notoriety of Colonel Buendía. Macondo’s governments change several times during and after the war. At one point, Arcadio, the cruelest of the Buendías, rules dictatorially and is eventually shot by a firing squad. Later, a mayor is appointed, and his reign is peaceful until another civil uprising has him killed. After his death, the civil war ends with the signing of a peace treaty.',

While locked in, Jane, believing that she sees her uncle’s ghost, screams and faints. She wakes to find herself in the care of Bessie and the kindly apothecary Mr. Lloyd, who suggests to Mrs. Reed that Jane be sent away to school. To Jane’s delight, Mrs. Reed concurs.Once at the Lowood School, Jane finds that her life is far from idyllic. The school’s headmaster is Mr. Brocklehurst, a cruel, hypocritical, and abusive man. Brocklehurst preaches a doctrine of poverty and privation to his students while using the school’s funds to provide a wealthy and opulent lifestyle for his own family. At Lowood, Jane befriends a young girl named Helen Burns, whose strong, martyrlike attitude toward the school’s miseries is both helpful and displeasing to Jane. A massive typhus epidemic sweeps Lowood, and Helen dies of consumption.

And bravery is needed to live authentically with your imperfections.Though when you practice living a true live where you think, speak, and act in congruence with yourself, not how you’re supposed to be, you open your heart to love yourself and others.The means to do this are to practice courage, compassion, and connection on a daily basis. Those are the gifts of imperfection.And don’t try to be perfect, you’ll live a lie because you’re not flawless and no one else is either. You’ll be happier when you embrace you’re human and have your faults, and allow others to help you or give you a shoulder to lean on.So don’t try to be the Hollywood star you admire (we know they have their issues) or the cool guy at the office. Instead be your authentic self and own your story, then you’ll be blessed with the gifts of imperfection.I challenge you, today, to go out and tell a trusted family member or friend how you’re feeling today and why.

If only it would go away, you tell yourself, then your life would be better.I spent years trying to fix me, trying to change aspects I hated, trying to fit into a version of what society thought was best. It resulted in corporate burnout, depression, eating disorders, and, at one point, even drug addiction.But in my darkness I found the light, I had a breakthrough: we are not our problems. There is nothing to fix. What if everything in our life is here by design? That thing you hate about yourself is not a flaw—but an invitation for more love. We can love ourselves more and the problems can dissipate.Despite what you might believe about yourself, you are not broken, you are not your problems, there’s nothing to fix, you’re not off track, there’s not something wrong with you, your insecurities are not hindering you, and your flaws don’t make you weak, unlovable, or unsuccessful. You are not doomed to fail or stay stuck forever.  Your angst, insecurities, and fears are not the problems in your life.The main problem is that we think we have these major problems. But our attention on them is what keeps it from going away. Tony Robbins said, “Problems need energy to live,” so naturally when we take our attention away from situations and focus more on our wellness instead of participating in the problem we can start to see the results we crave.Here are some surprising benefits of becoming your own best friend.',

Therefore, every time you tearfully ask yourself, ‘What is wrong with me?’, the answer is almost certainly a limiting and false subconscious belief.

Jen Sincero provides an outline of the impact that the subconscious mind has on our lives and the factors underpinning its influence: Our subconscious mind contains the blueprint for our lives. Therefore, our subconscious minds are running our lives based on unfiltered information gathered throughout our childhood. Jen labels this unfiltered information as our beliefs.We are, for the most part, completely oblivious to the subconscious beliefs that run our lives. When our conscious minds finally develop around late adolescence, it remains under the control of our subconscious mind. It does not matter how big and smart your brain becomes. Your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors will still be controlled by the beliefs that were adopted by your subconscious mind. ',

      'When we talk about loving ourselves and our bodies, you might think that self-esteem has a big role to play. However, the kind of self-love that the author is talking about – radical self-love – isn’t the same as self-esteem.We can look at radical self-love as a tropical island where self-esteem thrives. Rather than stopping at the shore of the radical self-love island, the self-esteem ship is pushed across the oceans by the winds of willpower and ego.Continuing this analogy, such ideals of self-esteem can cause the ship to crash. Consider all the arrogant and selfish people around the world characterized as confident and highly pleased with themselves. Though they may have high self-esteem levels, they don’t necessarily epitomize love.Take the current president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. From his behavior, he doesn’t appear to lack any self-confidence or self-esteem. But his ego, overconfidence and lack of loving ideals could lead the country into troubled waters.And radical self-love is more than self-acceptance.Think back to the times you merely accepted something. Were those moments particularly enjoyable or inspiring? Most likely not.Taylor recalls a time when her mother used to pop frozen pot pies into the oven for dinner. Though she accepted the bland meal, she didn’t find it particularly thrilling or inspiring.When it comes to treating ourselves with love and respect, we can do a lot better than self-acceptance. Over the coming book summarys, you’ll find out how to better the attitudes you have toward yourself and others. This will be your first step toward radical self-love.',

      'The theory of relativity built upon Newton’s theory of gravity by accounting for the speed of light being a constant. Einstein suggested that the laws of science are the same for all freely moving observers. Hence, this accounts for the constancy of the speed of light. No matter the speed of a freely moving observer, the speed of light will be the same. The reasoning behind this principle is that time is relative rather than fixed.Hawking uses an analogy to explain this point. Imagine a flash of light is emitted to two observers. One of these observers is traveling toward the light while the other is traveling faster in the opposite direction. The speed of the light remains the same for each observer as it is constant. However, time is determined by distance traveled divided by speed. Hence, the two observers would perceive the emitted light at different time points. Crucially, this means that neither observer would be incorrect in their recording of the time when the light was first emitted. Instead, time will be relative and unique to each of the observers.All matter consists of particles. Therefore, to better understand the universe, we need to understand particles, including how they behave and their speed. Hawking explains that particles are particularly difficult to measure, though. The more precisely you try to measure a particle’s position, the more uncertain its speed becomes. Similarly, the more precisely you try to measure its speed, the less specific the particle’s position becomes. This phenomenon was discovered in the 1920s and is called the uncertainty principle.To overcome the limitations of measuring particles, scientists started to measure the quantum state of the particles. Quantum state combines many likely possible positions and speeds of a particle. Hence, it is currently impossible for a scientist to observe the exact position and velocity of a particle. Instead, scientists have to track all the likely places it could be and determine which of these is most likely. This requires scientists to observe the particles as if they were waves.The variety of positions that a particle can appear in can be plotted as what looks like a continuous, oscillating wave. The most likely positions of the particle arise where arcs and dips conform to one another.',

      'From the beginning Carl really puts things in perspective. He starts by pointing out how small we are in the grand scheme of the Cosmos. Our civilization has thrived only for a couple thousand years. That may seem like a long time for most of us but the universe has existed for 13.8 billion years!!! That is 13,800,000,000 years! This is such a hard concept to grasp—Big numbers like this don’t really mean much to most people.For this reason, I must add a little disclaimer here, because my summary might miss a lot of the impact that is captured so well in the book. Things like a lightyear, or a million years can get very easily lost in words. So you might want to check out the new Cosmos series with Neil de Grasse Tyson after reading this, it will give you a much better ground before going down the rabbit hole that this book is.But if you’re still reading, we can start with the age of the Earth: 4.5 billion years old—and since it’s creation, it has been revolving around a single lonely star which we call the Sun. This star happens to be about 4.2 light years away from its nearest neighbor (Proxima Centauri). This means that light—the fastest thing there is—would take 4.2 years to get from Proxima Centauri to the Sun.It has been 400 years since Galileo first saw Venus through his telescope, and since then, we have already observed and identified tons of celestial bodies—such as red giants, white dwarfs, nebulae, pulsars, you name it! Objects that are so big and so far away that we can but observe in wonder. Nonetheless, we are clever creatures, and we have learned a great deal about the Cosmos—despite the astronomical distances.However there are still many mysteries that we havent solved, for example, we suspect there are other forms of matter and energy out there that we still cant even comprehend—and we resort to call them “dark”. Furthermore, we are not sure why we havent found other forms of life, statistically the Universe should be brimming with life! So where is everybody?... We dont know, as Carl said, “we are standing at the shores of the cosmic ocean...” and we have barely dipped our ankles.',

      'Throughout the course of an introduction, thirty chapters, and nearly five-hundred pages, Bryson highlights the creation of the Earth, where we are now as a species, and a lot of what has happened in between. Part One, consisting of Chapters 1-3, is about the cosmos. Here, Bryson starts by talking about the origins, theories, and qualities of the atom. He also introduces the theory of the Big Bang, and describes the complexities and disputes that inherently go along with it. Finally, he explores how the planets were discovered and how the universe was measured, supernovae, and how these things all relate back to theory of the Big Bang.Part Two, Chapters 4-7, is about the size of the Earth and the painstaking lengths scientists have gone to in order to figure out the age and weight of our planet. Bryson introduces a wide array of scientists who had a hand in determining these measurements, and gives helpful and often eccentric background information about each individual. Along the way, he explains how geology and chemistry became branches of science, the idea of plate tectonics, the discovery of dinosaur fossils and chemical elements, and a bit about thermodynamics. Yet by the end of these chapters, each of these ideas is related back to how the Earth was ultimately measured.Part Three, Chapters 8-12, visits Einstein’s theories of relativity and gravity.',

      'Darwin’s theory is based on the notion of variation. It argues that the numerous traits and adaptations that differentiate species from each other also explain how species evolved over time and gradually diverged. Variations in organisms are apparent both within domesticated species and within species throughout the natural world. Variations in colors, structures, organs, and physical traits differentiate a multitude of species from one another. Heredity is the mechanism that perpetuates variations, Darwin argues, as traits are passed from parents to offspring. What is important about these variations to Darwin, though, is the way they allow species to adapt and survive in the natural world. He gives numerous examples of variations that illustrate the wondrous adaptations that allow species to survive in their natural environments: the beak that allows the woodpecker to gather insects, the wings that allow the bat to fly, the paddles that allow the porpoise to swim, and so on. Darwin hypothesizes that the minor variations we see within a single species—such as variations in size, shape, and color of organisms—are related to the more distinct variations seen across different species. His theory of evolution explains how variations cause the origin of species.',

      'It tells the story of an African-American woman who died in 1951, aged just 31, of an aggressive cervical cancer. It also tells the story of her legacy: the HeLa cell line, taken from Henrietta’s tumour while she was still alive, cultured in a lab, and discovered to be immortal. After her death HeLa was mass-produced and sold to laboratories all over the world. It has been used in a vast and varied array of scientific research including research into cancer, the human genome, and the development of the polio vaccine, and it continues to be used to this day.However, it is not the scientific advances which HeLa helped bring about which made this book such an engrossing read for me, but the ethical issues that the book raises. Henrietta does not give consent for the mass-production and sale of her cells, and her family don’t see a penny of the profits from HeLa. In fact, they do not even learn of its existence until years after Henrietta’s death, and, once they do, are deeply disturbed by the idea that their mother’s cells are being experimented on. Given the focus on informed consent and communication in modern medicine, I found the complete lack of communication with Henrietta and her family shocking. Understandably it breeds in them a mistrust of health professionals and authority more generally. Skloot’s sensitive portrayal of Henrietta’s surviving children and their struggle to understand their mother’s “immortality” is interwoven with stories of other individuals whose tissues have been bought and sold, with or without their consent, to ask the compelling question: who owns our cells once they are no longer part of us?',

      'In the spring of 2016, writer Casey McQuiston, then 25 years old, was driving on the I-10 highway in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, when an idea for a novel came to her. Then came the presidential election. The Louisiana native, now 28, says she had to quickly “grapple with a world that was [now] different than we thought it was.” So she set her book aside for eight months. After a trip to Norway, away from news back home, she picked it up again and finished a first draft about six months later. The result is Red, White & Royal Blue, a romantic comic novel about political figures that became an unlikely New York Times bestseller.Set in a world in which a female Democrat from Texas wins the presidency in 2016, Red, White & Royal Blue chronicles the illicit romance between the president’s son, Georgetown senior Alex Claremont-Diaz (Dad is a Mexican-American senator), and Prince Henry of Wales, his childhood nemesis. The book leverages an old romantic comedy trope: the fake relationship that becomes true love. (“Oh my God,” says Alex’s sister June in the book, “this is like all those romantic comedies where the girl hires a male escort to pretend to be her wedding date and then falls in love with him for real.”) After ruining a royal wedding, Alex and Henry are forced to act out a friendship for the press, and they slowly warm to each other, developing a passionate relationship. Alex comes to terms with his bisexuality and Henry struggles with family pressure to stay closeted.',

      'Ten-year-old Harry Potter is an orphan who lives in the fictional London suburb of Little Whinging, Surrey, with the Dursleys: his uncaring Aunt Petunia, loathsome Uncle Vernon, and spoiled cousin Dudley. The Dursleys barely tolerate Harry, and Dudley bullies him. One day Harry is astonished to receive a letter addressed to him in the cupboard under the stairs (where he sleeps). Before he can open the letter, however, Uncle Vernon takes it. Letters for Harry subsequently arrive each day, in increasing numbers, but Uncle Vernon tears them all up, and finally, in an attempt to escape the missives, the Dursleys go to a miserable shack on a small island. On Harry’s 11th birthday, a giant named Hagrid arrives and reveals that Harry is a wizard and that he has been accepted at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He also sheds light on Harry’s past, informing the boy that his parents, a wizard and a witch, were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort and that Harry acquired the lightning-bolt scar on his forehead during the fatal confrontation.Upon arrival at the school, the students are sorted into one of four houses—Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. Harry ends up in Gryffindor, and during his eventful first year at Hogwarts he becomes close friends with two other members of the house, Ron Weasley, who comes from an old wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, whose parents are Muggles (those who are not magical). Harry also finds that he has an enemy in Draco Malfoy (Slytherin). In addition, Harry’s prowess in flying on a broomstick makes him a star of Gryffindor’s Quidditch team. Hoping to get Harry and his friends into trouble, Draco tricks them into leaving their rooms one night, a violation of school rules. While trying to avoid being caught, they discover a three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor. Harry gradually comes to the conclusion that Professor Snape, who teaches Potions, dislikes him intensely and is trying to get hold of whatever is behind the trapdoor. Harry receives his father’s cloak of invisibility as a Christmas gift, and, while exploring under the cloak’s cover, he finds the Mirror of Erised, in which he can see his parents. Later, headmaster Albus Dumbledore explains that the mirror shows the viewer’s deepest desire.',

Each day on his way to school, Charlie passes the best and biggest chocolate factory in the world, run by the secretive Willy Wonka. When Charlie’s father loses his job, things go from bad to worse. Grandpa Joe tells Charlie that in the past, competitors stole Wonka’s candy-making secrets, and the factory shut down. Later, the factory resumed production, but no one was ever seen entering or leaving. One day, Wonka announces that he has hidden golden tickets in five Wonka chocolate bars, with the prize of a tour of the factory and a lifetime supply of Wonka products for each child who finds a ticket. Wonka-mania encircles the globe, and one by one four of the tickets are found. Charlie finds money sticking out of a snowbank and buys himself two Wonka chocolate bars; the second contains the last golden ticket.The five children are greeted outside the factory by the eccentric visionary Willy Wonka. The inside of the chocolate factory is magical, and the workers are revealed to be the tiny cacao-loving Oompa-Loompas, rescued from Loompaland by Wonka. As the tour progresses, four of the children, too self-centred to follow the rules, suffer bizarre—and often painful—consequences. In the Chocolate Room, the gluttonous Augustus Gloop falls into the river of chocolate and is sucked into a glass pipe carrying the liquid chocolate to be made into fudge. The gum-obsessed Violet Beauregarde steals a piece of experimental chewing gum, which turns her into a blueberry. The extremely spoiled Veruca Salt tries to seize a trained squirrel to have for herself, but the squirrels identify her as a bad nut and toss her down a garbage chute. Mike Teavee inserts himself into an experiment on sending candy bars through television and is shrunk to pocket size. The Oompa-Loompas regularly break into moralizing songs to comment on the children’s misbehaviour. At last, Wonka tells Charlie that, because of his respectful behaviour, he is being given the chocolate factory.',

Similarly to the pilot in his story, while flying a mission during World War II, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s plane was shot down, and it disappeared somewhere over the Mediterranean.The Little Prince is an honest and beautiful story about loneliness, friendship, sadness, and love. The prince is a small boy from a tiny planet (an asteroid to be precise), who travels the universe, planet-to-planet, seeking wisdom. On his journey, he discovers the unpredictable nature of adults. “All grown-ups were once children… but only a few of them remember it.The story begins on Earth with the narrator—a crashed pilot stranded in the Sahara Desert, who is trying hard to repair his wrecked plane. One day a little boy, oddly dressed, shows up out of nowhere and insists that the pilot draw him a sheep. The pilot obeys this odd request, which strangely enough leads to the pilot learning more about the Little Prince and where he came from. What unfolds is a marvelous story that some will deem happy and some will find sad. Either way, all readers will have their minds opened wide and will hopefully grow up to be adults that will always remember they were once children, too. The Little Prince is a thin book with its mere ninety-eight pages, but don’t be fooled; it’s a brilliant book meant to be deeply thought about and to encourage you to build castles in the air.',

She has many wondrous, often bizarre adventures with thoroughly illogical and very strange creatures, often changing size unexpectedly (she grows as tall as a house and shrinks to 3 inches [7 cm]). She encounters the hookah-smoking Caterpillar, the Duchess (with a baby that becomes a pig), and the Cheshire Cat, and she attends a strange endless tea party with the Mad Hatter and the March Hare. She plays a game of croquet with an unmanageable flamingo for a croquet mallet and uncooperative hedgehogs for croquet balls while the Queen calls for the execution of almost everyone present. Later, at the Queen’s behest, the Gryphon takes Alice to meet the sobbing Mock Turtle, who describes his education in such subjects as Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Alice is then called as a witness in the trial of the Knave of Hearts, who is accused of having stolen the Queen’s tarts.
